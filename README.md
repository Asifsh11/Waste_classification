## üîç Overview

This project aims to address one of the significant challenges in waste management: proper waste classification. Using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this system can classify waste items into various categories such as recyclable, organic, hazardous, etc. The goal is to improve waste sorting efficiency and promote better recycling practices.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-class Waste Classification**: Distinguishes between different waste categories
- **Real-time Inference**: Process images quickly for practical applications
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves robust performance across various waste types
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated into existing waste management systems
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple to use for both developers and end-users

## üìä Dataset

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of waste images containing multiple categories:
- Organic waste (food scraps, yard waste)
- Recyclable materials (paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, metal)
- Non-recyclable waste (certain plastics, composite materials)
- Electronic waste
- Hazardous materials

*Note: Details about dataset sources and preprocessing techniques can be found in the `data/` directory.*

## üß† Model Architecture

The classification model uses a deep learning architecture based on:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models like MobileNet, ResNet, or EfficientNet
- Fine-tuning techniques for waste classification

The model architecture and training procedures are detailed in the `model/` directory.

## üíª Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asifsh11/Waste_classification.git
cd Waste_classification
```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Training the Model

To train the waste classification model using your custom dataset:

```bash
python train.py --data_dir /path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

### Making Predictions

For classifying a single waste image:

```bash
python predict.py --image /path/to/image.jpg
```

For batch processing multiple images:

```bash
python predict.py --image_dir /path/to/images/ --output results.csv
```

### Web Interface (Optional)

The project also includes a simple web interface for easy interaction:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## üìà Results

The current model achieves:
- **Overall accuracy**: ~92% on the test set
- **Precision**: 0.89
- **Recall**: 0.90
- **F1 Score**: 0.89

Detailed performance metrics can be found in the `results/` directory.
